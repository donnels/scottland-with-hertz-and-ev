== Subject: Complaint and Claim for Unsatisfactory Experience with Hertz EV Rental

Dear Hertz Customer Service Team,

I hope this letter finds you well. I am writing to express my deep dissatisfaction and frustration with my recent experience renting an electric vehicle (EV) from Hertz during my trip to the Highlands of Scotland. The purpose of this letter is to outline the numerous issues and challenges I encountered during my rental and to request a resolution for these problems.

1. Vehicle Rental at EDI Airport:
   - I had initially booked a fuel automatic "Kompaktklasse" car (Kia Ceed or similar).
   - However, I was given a brand-new Polestar 2 as an upgrade because there were no other cars available. This was not an upgrade, as the size of the car did not compensate for the issues I faced.

2. Vehicle Specifications:
   - The stated range of the Polestar 2 was "at least 380 miles" according to Hertz information.
   - In reality, the car's range when fully charged was a maximum of 240 miles.

3. Age and Condition of the Car:
   - Hertz claimed the car was "brand new."
   - In reality, the car had been in use for over half a year and had 9,339 miles on it. Furthermore, there were damages to the rims that Hertz failed to acknowledge during the rental process and has now invoiced me for.

4. Charging Difficulties:
   - While charging in Scotland should have been straightforward, it turned into a nightmare.
   - Hertz assured me that using an electric car in the Highlands was "not a problem," but this was blatantly false.
   - Many charging stations were broken, had low charging speeds, or only accepted RFID cards.
   - Hertz did not provide a ChargeScotland card, which would have been immensely helpful.
   - The lack of reliable charging options forced me to spend hours per day searching for working chargers, altering my travel plans, and missing out on attractions.

5. Customer Service:
   - The contact number provided on my contract was fake, and I received no assistance from Hertz.
   - Calls went unanswered, and web chat directed me to "call roadside assistance," which was not helpful.
   - I was given inaccurate information about the opening hours for returning the car at Holyhead Port, causing significant inconvenience.

6. Return Charges:
   - Hertz threatened to charge me £800 for returning the vehicle to a different location.
   - After contacting Hertz multiple times, I was told it would only cost £166.67, but the inconvenience remained significant.

7. Additional Driver Charges:
   - I was charged for an additional driver despite it being offered for free during the booking process.

8. Charging Station Issues at Various Locations:
   - I faced numerous issues with charging stations at various locations, including Dunoon, Colwyn Bay, Oban, Tobermory, Port Kilchoan, Ardnamurchan Lighthouse, and Lancaster.

9. Overall Vacation Experience:
   - My vacation in Scotland was marred by constant charging problems, extra costs, and disappointing experiences. It was far from the enjoyable trip I had envisioned.

I kindly request that Hertz addresses these issues promptly and provides a resolution for the inconveniences I have endured. I look forward to your prompt response and a fair resolution to these problems.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
